r. Check adjustment of door microswitches (see Paragraph 56).
s. Close door uplock by hand and mark the fully locked position of slider (see Figure 6-4-5).
t. With gear ground safety pins installed and gear selected down, place ground servicing switch to closed position and slowly close door using hand pump. Observe alignment of door pin with door uplock. Lock should snap fully closed with a definite snap action and slider should align with mark (see Step s). A considerable gap should be present between door and wing skin with eccentric adjusted as in Step m.
u. Open door and adjust eccentric one notch at a time to bring door up flush with wing skin within 0.794 mm (1/32 in.).
NOTE During the adjustment of the door eccentric, it is essential that the pin enters the uplock freely and that uplock rotation is not restricted when final locking occurs. If, after vertical adjustment is obtained, the uplock does not close with a definite snap action to the fully locked position as indicated by the mark made in Step s, carry out the following checks:
(1) Check that uplock pin diameter is between 19.037 and 19.063 mm (0.7495 and 0.7505 in.), modified pin 18.3 ±0.051 mm (0.720 ±0.002 in.).
(2) Check lateral position of uplock eccentric pin in relation to position of uplock jaws. If misalignment is indicated, reposition eccentric to opposite side of arc, i.e., if pin is positioned at 9 o'clock, reposition to 3 o'clock.
(3) If satisfactory operation of uplock is not obtained in Steps (1) or (2), remove 6.35 mm (1/4 in.) bolt which retains uplock in its mounting bracket and recheck uplock operation. If operation is now satisfactory, slightly elongate holes in mounting bracket to allow sufficient rotation of uplock to ensure that uplock is free to align with pin in closed position.
v. Recheck clearance at outer forward edge of door when rear door frame is in contact with stop as in Step j.
w. Close door and recheck clearances and door in opening as in Step l.
x. Check adjustment of leg door latch mechanism as in Paragraph 15.
y. Remove ground safety locking pins from all three gears and carry out functional test of landing gear (see Paragraph 55).
