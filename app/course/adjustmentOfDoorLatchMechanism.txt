ADJUSTMENT OF DOOR LATCH MECHANISM
15. Adjustment of the door latch mechanism is provided by an adjustable eye-end at the spring end of the push-rod, and an eccentric cam on the latch hook pivot pin (see Figure 6-4-7). On closure of a main wheel door with the gear extended, the latch mechanism should be checked for correct engagement by the roller on the door. Further checks to be made are as follows:
a. With main gear down and locked and main wheel door closed, adjust door latch mechanism to position latch hook to near vertical position.
b. Open main wheel door. Check that drive fork of latch mechanism is sprung against stop.
c. Apply Plasticine to inner curve of latch hook.
d. Jack and steady aircraft (see C-12-114-000/ MF-001).
e. Retract and lock gear up and then lower gear (see Paragraph 55).
f. Check that Plasticine indicates that distance between inside of spigot and inner curve of latch hook is at least 11.4 mm (0.45 in.).
g. If necessary, adjust on push-rod eye-end to obtain this clearance, repeating foregoing checks after any adjustment, and ensuring main wheel door roller enters jaws of drive fork centrally.
h. Apply Plasticine to tip of latch hook so that Plasticine protrudes between 1.27 and 2.54 mm (0.05 and 0.1 in.) at tip.
i. Retract gear slowly to house gear in wheel well, selecting gear DOWN immediately when gear is housed to prevent main wheel door from closing.
j. Check by impression made on Plasticine that leg door spigot clears latch hook by at least 1.02 mm (0.040 in.).
k. Carry out any necessary locking and ensure that eye-end of push-rod is in safety. Remove all traces of Plasticine.
l. Lower aircraft to ground (see C-12-114-000/ MF-001) and remove jacking equipment.
