    <instructions>
      <step>
        <instruction>a. Offer up actuator in fully retracted and locked position. Connect hydraulic lines (4, 5 and 7) to their respective connections.</instruction>
        <warning>To prevent future chafting, ensure hose connect fittings are correctly oriented during installation of MLG actuator. Following hose connection, check for adequate clearance between actautor hose and wing skin.</warning>
        <note>Before installing actuator, treat unplated shaft of main gear spigot with zinc chromate primer.</note>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>b. Connect actuator to side stay with bolt (6), washer, nut and cotter pin.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>c. Install lower side stay to leg bolt. Washer with chamfered hole to be installed under head of bolt with chamfer towards head.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>d. Install ground safety locking pins to other two gears.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>e. Initially adjust actuator length to obtain a free fit onto main gear spigot with side stay held in over-centre position and 10 342 kPa (1500 psi) applied to close actuator.</instruction>
        <note>1. The stroke of the piston is a nominal 123 mm (4.83 in.), plus an overtravel of between 5.92 and 6.76 mm (0.233 and 0.266 in.). Adjustment Â±3.81 mm (0.15 in.) about nominal, in increments of 0.025 mm (0.001 in.), is obtainable by means of the piston-rod eye-end. Piston-rod and cylinder attachment eye-ends each have a Teflon-lined self-aligning spherical bearing installed. The actuator is attached by the cylinder eye-end to the forked lug of the side stay and by the piston-rod eye-end to a tapered spigot at the top of the leg. The eye-end bearings do not require lubrication. 
2. To decrease gap at knuckle joint, screw rod end in. To increase gap, screw rod end out.</note>
        <warning>Do not turn piston-rod when actuator is retracted and locked, as lock claws may be damaged.</warning>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>f. Install washer and nut on pin (2). Note that a thrust washer (3) is installed at the inner face. Ensure that thrust washer is positioned with chamfered side towards gear. Ensure that eye-end of actuator is in safety. Eye-end locknut is to be torqued on completion of adjustment to value detailed in Figure 6-4-14 and lockwired.g. Carry out precautions for functional test of gear (see Paragraph 55). Select ground servicing switch (LH wheel well) to OPEN, thereby permitting hydraulic pressure to build up to 10 342 kPa (1500 psi) without main wheel door closing.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>h. Top up hydraulic reservoir (see C-12-114-000/ MF-001).</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>i. With gear extended and locked, check that ground safety locking pin can be easily inserted and removed with hydraulic pressure first at 10 342 kPa (1500 psi) and then at zero.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>j. With 10 342 kPa (1500 psi) pressure applied, check normal down line for leaks. Correct any leak.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>k. Disconnect leg door from leg (see Paragraph 16).</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>l. Retract and lock gear up. Check up line for leaks at 10 342 kPa (1500 psi). Correct any leak.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>m. Release hydraulic pressure. Remove nut and washer from pin (2) and release main actuator from pin ensuring that length does not alter.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>n. With actuator held clear of its attachment point, apply 10 342 kPa (1500 psi) hydraulic pressure to fully extend actuator and check that movement indicates that at least 3.175 mm (1/8 in.) overtravel is available.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <note>The actuator shall not be adjusted at this stage, otherwise the clearance at the side stay knuckle joint (see Step i) will alter. If required overtravel is not obtained, repeat Steps e and i, and check actuator stroke if necessary (see C-13-499-000/MS-000).</note>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>o. Release hydraulic pressure. Reconnect actuator (see Step f) and lock the nut with cotter pin.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>p. Using L.G. HAND PUMP SELECT handle (see Paragraph 55), lower the gear. Ensure that gear lowers correctly and locks down. Build up pressure to 10 342 kPa (1500 psi) and check emergency down line for leaks, correcting any leak.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>q. Push L.G. HAND PUMP SELECT handle in and pressurize normal down line to ensure that shuttle valves are positioned for normal operation.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>r. Reconnect leg door to leg (see Paragraph 17).</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>s. With main wheel door still inoperative, check operation of gear (see Paragraph 55) as follows:</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>(1) Operate gear several times to pass any air remaining in system to hydraulic reservoir.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>(2) Check that gear retracts and locks up and that, when hydraulic pressure is released, uplock retains gear up. During retraction, check that clearances between component parts, piping, etc, are within stipulated limits.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>(3) Check that, when gear is selected DOWN, uplock releases and that gear lowers and locks in the extended position.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>t. Connect plug (1) to limit switch socket.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>u. With main wheel door operative, operate the gear. During test, check that doors function correctly and that operating pressures for retraction, locking up, releasing uplock and locking down, are within stipulated limits. Check time taken to lower gear.</instruction>
      </step>
      <step>
        <instruction>v. Install ground safety locking pin. Check all items removed or disturbed during the course of these operations for correct locking and, where applicable, that they are safetied.</instruction>
