LEG DOOR
REMOVAL
16. Proceed as follows (see Figure 6-4-8):
a. Ensure that ground safety locking pins are installed on all three gears.
b. Disconnect link (7) from door by removing cotter pin (12), washer and pin (5). If it is necessary to remove hinge (13), remove cotter pin (6), washer, and pin (11).
c. Jack and steady aircraft (see C-12-114-000/ MF-001).
d. Remove ground safety locking pin from gear being serviced and retract gear (see Paragraph 55).
e. With leg door supported, remove the five screws (1) and washers securing door hinge to hinge beam and remove door and, if installed, tapered shims (2).
INSTALLATION
17. Proceed as follows (see Figure 6-4-8):
a. Ensure that gear is in correct adjustment (see Paragraph 3).
b. With applicable gear in the up position with leg door connecting link (7) removed or taped to the leg, attach door to hinge beam with five screws (1) and washers.
c. Push up door by hand and check fit of door with wing box. If necessary, install tapered shims (2) under hinge to align door with wing lower skin. Trim door as required to obtain a gap of 1.52 ±0.762 mm (0.060 ±0.030 in.). If hinge pin (3) is excessively worn, replace with 2.44 or 2.50 mm (0.096 or 0.098 in.) diameter pin.
d. With hydraulic pressure released and gear hanging in uplock, ensure that a minimum clearance of 2.54 mm (0.1 in.) exists between door and any part of leg. If necessary, check with Plasticine, paying particular attention to clearance between brake line and door.
e. With leg door held closed, ensure that light contact is maintained between latch hook and leg door spigot, and that door latch mechanism (see Figure 6-4-7) can be moved freely to locked position. Leg door shall be flush with wing skin within ±0.794 mm (±1/32 in.). The tolerance may be obtained by adjusting the eccentric pivot pin.
f. Lower gear (see Paragraph 55). Install ground safety locking pin.
NOTE Ensure that there is no binding between movable parts of the link assembly.
g. If necessary, attach hinge (13) to bracket (4) using pin (5), washer and cotter pin (12), ensuring that head of pin (5) faces upward.
h. Attach connecting link (7) to hinge (13) with pin (11), washer and cotter pin (6), ensuring that pin head is facing forward and is flush with fork-end. Ensure that fork pivot cut-outs are facing towards brake bleed valve, as shown.
i. Adjust connecting link (7) to lightly compress rubber stop (14) against leg.
j. Remove ground safety locking pin and retract gear by means of hydraulic hand pump (see Paragraph 55).
k. With main wheel door open and gear held up by hydraulic pressure, check that door is open at least 1.59 mm (1/16 in.) at inboard end, noting that mismatch shall not exceed 4.76 mm (3/16 in.). If incorrect, lower gear and adjust connecting link (7), retracting gear on completion of adjustment.
NOTE
This check is to be carried out with gear held fully up in the uplock by hydraulic pressure, electrical power being maintained on the landing gear selector valve to keep valve open by retracting the one gear only.
l. Release hydraulic pressure to permit gear to hang in uplock. Ensure that leg door is open not more than 6.35 mm (1/4 in.) at inboard end.
m. Check that leg door can move freely to closed position and that latch mechanism can be moved manually to fully latched position. Ensure that a minimum clearance of 0.635 mm (0.025 in.) exists between connecting link (7) fork-end and leg.
n. If connecting link (7) required adjustment during Step k, recheck position of rubber stop with gear down. Trim rubber stop or install oversize stop as required to obtain light compression of rubber pad in gear down position.
o. With gear retracted and locked up, close main wheel door and check that leg door, when engaged by latch hook, is closed flush (see Paragraph 15 for door latch mechanism adjustment procedure). Check that gap between main wheel door and leg door is between 1.52 and 2.54 mm (0.060 and 0.100 in.).
p. Lower gear. Ensure that cotter pins (11 and 6), and cotter pin for nut (10) are installed. Lockwire connecting link (7), locknut and fork-end as shown.
NOTE Door attachment pin locking bolt (9) shall be secured with toothed washer (8) only and shall not be lockwired.
q. Operate the gear and check that operating pressures and times are within stipulated limits (see Paragraph 55).
r. Ensure that all items removed or disturbed during the course of these operations are correctly locked and, where applicable, in safety.
s. Release nitrogen from leg, fully collapse leg and check that there is at least 0.508 mm (0.020 in.) clearance between brake bleed valve adapter and leg door connecting link.
t. Recharge leg (see C-12-114-000/MF-001).
u. Check that landing gear control lever is in DOWN position and electrical MASTER switch is to GRD PWR. Apply system maximum hydraulic pressure to down lines and check that gears show down and locked.
v. Install ground safety locking pins, disconnect and remove ground power, lower aircraft to ground (see C-12-114-000/MF-001) and remove jacking equipment.
